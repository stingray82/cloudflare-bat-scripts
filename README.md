my collection of bat scripts for Cloudflare they are used by me to do things and I am sharing them with the wider world as I may have shown them on a video or think they have use for others;
### Insta.bat
This will allow mapping of a Cname (New or Update) for particular zone, this was designed for working with the map domain function at https://app.instawp.io/register?ref=6OzmdOOpOK of Instawp.

Instructions for use, modify the variables at the top and your ready to go, optional but for Quality of Life, add the bat to a path directory and then launch it from anywhere create your site in Instawp, select map and begin the process, useful for creators and video creators alike, no need to login to Cloudflare or manually do this.

### Insta2.bat
This is the same as Insta.bat but supports multiple domains and keys for updating
